# WorkFlowManager---Interapt

In order to automate the allocation of right employees at the right place, system first will take inputs such as Project Information, Required Skills, working experience, expertise etc. and will map the respective employees based on their skills and working experience and will find the list of right employees for the project and will also consider the work life balance of each and every employee by calculating 'Burnout Rate' of each employee. This recommended list will overcome the drawback of biasness & familiarity and we will have suitable employees who are stress free and at the same time will have the required skills and capabilities in order to complete the project

System will also have a AI conversational chatbot which will not only help to pull up the information of any particular project but also make sure to complete the appointed tasks. It will be easy to adapt this solution as user will not require to remember any specific command/process for desirable output. User can simply ask any query at his own comfort and language which he uses to chat with other people in daily life. System will automatically understand given query using AI technologies(NLP + NLU) and can respond based on confidence score.
